                        The journey of TMM began with the managing Book Bank of Shri K.V.O.S. Jain Mahajan in 1969. At the beginning of each academic
                        year, students get the entire set of required textbooks against a nominal refundable deposit.</p>



                    <p>Till June 2015 more than 34,000 students have been extended the helping hand to pursue their studies.</p>



                    <p>Incidental to this, notebooks, school uniforms, raincoats/umbrella and other education related things
                        are distributed free of cost to the poorest of poor of the society irrespective of caste, creed,
                        colour, faith or religion. Many students, with the support of this project, have fulfilled their
                        ambitions of pursuing higher studies and are now well placed in the society, after graduating in
                        streams like Medical, Engineering, Chartered Accountancy, etc.</p>



                    <p>Book Bank centers are operated at Chincpokli, Mulund, Ambernath, Nalasopala, Ghatkopar, Dombivili and
                        Andheri so as to reach out to as many needy students as possible.</p>

                    <p>We issue fresh sets of textbooks at a refundable amount of Rs.100, and digests at a refundable amount
                        of Rs.250. While the students return their set of books with minimum depreciation, the paid amount
                        is refunded.</p>



                    <p>Every year around 1,300 students are issued with Text Books & Digests. In 2014 around 1,392 sets of books
                        were issued.</p>
